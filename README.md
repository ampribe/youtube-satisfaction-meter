# YouTubeSatisfactionMeter
Do you find better YouTube videos on your subscriptions page or your home page? YouTubeSatisfactionMeter is a Firefox extension that identifies the sources that provide the best YouTube videos. YouTubeSatisfactionMeter displays your satisfaction after watching each video along with its source. 

The extension was inspired by [this post](https://www.george-mack.com/content/i-regret-watching-72-of-youtube-videos).
